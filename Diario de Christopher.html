                <h3 class="titulo3">One Day With Love Conflicts</h3>
                    <p>It&apos;s been a while since I&#39;ve written, but I&apos;m doing so for my mental health. I think I should. Now, I have a new crush on a guy. I don&apos;t remember when I met him, but he wrote to me and our conversation became a little intense. There is some sexual tension, and I&apos;m not sure what to do about it. I have a lot of distrust towards him and don&apos;t want to get involved in conflicts that make me feel guilty. I want peace, but at the same time, I want to live, experience, and taste life. I want to know and to fly, and if it&apos;s necessary to crash, I will crash and get up again. However, I&apos;m beginning to doubt the way I&apos;m living. It feels very boring and repetitive. It&apos;s good, but I feel incomplete. I don&apos;t know if I&apos;m being ungrateful, but I&apos;m tired of fighting against this part of me that I hate. I just want to let it be.</p>

                <h3 class="titulo3">Overthinking About Love</h3>
                    <p>Well, I guess I should try to be consistent with this. Today was just a regular day – neither good not bad. I&apos;ve been thinking about that guy from yesterday. I try not to create elaborate scenarios in my head, but it&apos;s inevitable. Ever since I watched heartstopper, I can&apos;t seem to just like someone without immediately imagining a whole movie where… I don&apos;t know… we meet, star a relationship, live a happy life, far from everything and everyone annoying us, as if we lived in a bubble. But it&apos;s all just my imagination. It&apos;s great for creativity, but in other areas, like being realistic, it&apos;s a real inconvenience. I mean, it&apos;s confusing, it gets me involved, it hurts me, and then I can&apos;t maintain the peace I worked so hard to achieve.</p>
                    <p>I guess I&apos;m very comfortable in my comfort zone, and I don&apos;t want to leave. But I have to. How am I going to live? I&apos;ll regret it for the rest of my life if I don&apos;t allow myself to have some experiences. But I need to be careful. No one should notice. I guess that&apos;s what frustrates me, the dependence I have on my family, and constantly thinking about what the think or say about me if the find out. But then I get into this conflict about what / think about myself. And sometimes I&apos;m just embarrassed of myself because I don&apos;t have all the things I could have had if I&apos;d tried harder in the past. But well, I&apos;m here, trying these fifteen glow-up steps and hoping to reach my goal. and decrees that it shall be so

                <h3 class="titulo3">What About the Future and Other Lovers</h3>
                    <p>So., tonight I&apos;m preparing for an electroencephalogram, which means I have to go sleep later, around midnight. Before that, I spent a little time playing guitar, made a TikTok, and then it occurred to me to look at the curriculum for other degrees that might be easier for me. Maybe education. I also looked at industrial engineering, but realistically, I&apos;d probably graduate in like ten years with that degree. It&apos;s just too much for me. I love the idea of saying I&apos;m an engineer, but I have to be honest with myself – it&apos;s unrealistic. It&apos;s complicated degree with difficult subjects, and I&apos;d have to dedicate a lot of time and energy, which I don&apos;t have. The best decision is to study a degree that&apos;s more aligned with my abilities, and it seems integral education is the closest fit. I think I could be a good educator. I&apos;ll keep thinking about it.</p>    
                    <p>
                    <p>In other news, it seems I have a potential love interest, and I think I like him a little. But I don&apos;t know. he&apos;s far away, and based on his characteristics, I&apos;m not sure if he&apos;s really my type. He does awaken a part of me that I try to hide. I just hope these fizzles out. Although, I would like to see him and satisfy my curiosity about a love adventure. I mean, it was crazy, bold, and… I guess it was the adrenaline that made me do something stupid! However, I need stay sane. There are a lot of more important things to do, and I need to focus. I decree that it will be a great day.</p>

                    <p>I&apos;ve been talking to a guy for a few days. He&apos;s not exactly handsome, but I find him very pleasant. Id like to go on a date with him, but I&apos;m afraid my family will find out, or someone will see us and judge me. It&apos;s embarrassing because he&apos;s openly gay, and I don&apos;t think anyone deserves to be hidden. Sometimes I imagine having a relationship, being happy with someone, and I see this as a good opportunity. But I&apos;m afraid. Not to mention the fact that his profile says he&apos;s a top, and I&apos;m bisexual (definitely not a bottom). So, I don&apos;t know what will happen. Maybe nothing. However, I&apos;m going to try to go on a date with him and have a nice experience with someone I like, and above all, someone who likes me. that&apos;s never happened before.</p>

                    <p>I think I&apos;m experiencing bit of karma this weekend. I suspect I&apos;m heading towards burnout or a kind depression. I&apos;m not exactly unhappy, but I wish I had more willpower to deal with everything that&apos;s happening. I&apos;ve stopped training, taking care of my skin, and even my diet has suffered. I go to work, but I feel I&apos;m just going through the motions. What&apos;s more, I don&apos;t feel like singing anymore. I just want to escape to the mountains or somewhere similar, where I can think, feel free, and be away from everyone and everything. I need to breathe a little. I also a lot of pressure for some reason. I&apos;m worried about not making progress.</p>

                    <p>Well, here I am again, awake early and unable to sleep. I&apos;ve been thinking about a lot of things. I keep remembering what my boss said to me. I started and almost finished a reality show about clothing designers, and that&apos;s made me think about how much I enjoy designing shoes, creating my logo, and all sorts of other things. Things I never followed through on; I just gave up. It&apos;s made me realize that maybe my dream of being a clothing designer is more realistic than becoming a famous singer. But I know I need to learn a lot more about it. I also need time for other things I want to do, and, well, money… Lately, I&apos;ve been wondering if I&apos;ve wasted too much money. I though renovating my mother&apos;s apartment would be a smoother process, but I see now that it won&apos;t be. </p> 
                    <p> It&apos;s an investment, and even though we&apos;re not making much advance right now, we will be soon. I need that space to be my inspirational place, somewhere I can clear my head, recently, I&apos;ve had so many ideas, and I don&apos;t know which ones are the right ones. Design, singing, piano, sports, languages, programing… I feel like I&apos;m trying to do too much, and maybe I can&apos;t handle it all. I feel like I&apos;m wasting time, and I&apos;m falling apart. I need more direction and perspective. God, please give me that. Give me clarity and willpower, and give me the time to achieve everything.</p>

                pleasing everyone except me</h3>
                <p>Today was an exhausting day. It&apos;s funny because yesterday I was really excited about going to this recital and, for the most part, it was enjoyable. But right now, I&apos;m feeling a bit overwhelmed by some thoughts. Last night, I went out with my best friend and her girlfriend. When the party started, I was having fun for a while, but then I just wanted to go home, actually, yesterday felt like was just going along with my friend&apos;s plans, and I didn&apos;t feel comfortable with myself. I would have preferred to do other things like… I don&apos;t know, I&apos;m not sure why I decided to go with them. I mean, they are my friends, but right now, I just see them as choir classmates, and that&apos;s it.</p>
                    <p> I&apos;m also trying to figure out who in my social circle I want to include in my new friend group. I think I know what the best option is now, but yesterday I was unsure. I don&apos;t think I made the right decision. I need to learn to be more authentic. I know how to be myself, but I need to practice it more. Yesterday, I definitely wasn&apos;t. I went out to eat with this people, and I don&apos;t know why! Should have stopped when I was walking by basketball court near island Park. I shouldn&apos;t have gone with those guys just to seek validation. I should have trusted that those who appreciate me would have sought me out.</p> 
                    <p>I should understand that what truly matters is enjoying the moment, If I know something won&apos;t make me happy, I shouldn&apos;t do it. I feel like I could be happy with this guy in many ways, but as always, something holds me back. It&apos;s so annoying because I really want a relationship, but there are so many things I need to consider, even after what steffanni said. Maybe I should just steal a kiss, like in romantic movies or love stories. We do have a lot in common, I&apos;m confused. I don&apos;t want problems, but I also don&apos;t want to miss out on experiences. Speaking of which, I don&apos;t know if I did the right thing telling my best friends about what he told me, especially since he asked me not to tell anyone. But they&apos;re my best friends, and sharing things with then makes me feel better. I suspect Rafael did the same thing with his best friend, telling him things about me that I specifically asked him not to share.</p>
                <p>that&apos;s why I was angry when hector told me. Please, just let me have some peace with this! Now, today my father decided to talk to me about the renovations at our house. I enjoy. But I need to get over it because this is something I want, and I&apos;ll do anything to achieve this goal. And, well, money is what we need, and I have faith that God will provide. So, let it be done, God, this week was a bit hectic, But I&apos;ve already had some rest, and I&apos;ll have more time to clear my head. The gym has been a big help, and I hope I can accomplish everything I want to during my vacation. So be it. In fact, I believe it already is, I hope this manifestation works. I&apos;m not sleeping much these days. Tomorrow we have a lot to do.

                <h3 class="titulo3">Passing Lovers</h3>
                    <p>Well, today was another very hard day. I&apos;m at work again with my coworkers, and they&apos;re… I don&apos;t know, I don&apos;t feel much affection for them. They&apos;re really lazy. Today, for example, out of eight destinations we scanned, I scanned four. That&apos;s unfair, seriously? Is this my reward for being efficient? I&apos;m really fed up with my job. I desperately want a different job, one I like, one I love. I don&apos;t hate my job, but I work with terrible coworkers-very toxic, very… I don&apos;t know. They&apos;re the kind of people everyone wants to avoid. I don&apos;t know what to do! I&apos;m so tired that I read lines over and over again and still can&apos;t focus. I have a plan to change jobs, but I haven&apos;t gotten down to work on it yet. I need more time in the afternoons to dedicate to it. Only then will I have enough time to do the programing course and, well, apply for a better job. I know I&apos;m setting what seems like an easy goal, but it&apos;s actually much harder than it seems. But I have to try. I have to do what&apos;s necessary to grow, to be happy, to be free!</p>
                        <p> talking about happiness, there&apos;s this friend I&apos;m starting to like. I&apos;m not sure if he feels the same way about me, and I&apos;ve been wondering if I should ask him out or do something like a movie night. That would be amazing! I see him as a reflection of myself. When he talks to me, it&apos;s like he&apos;s describing me because we&apos;ve had very similar experiences. We have the same tastes, so much in common, and it&apos;s like, wow! I&apos;m really starting to like him. he gives me such good vibes; he&apos;s a really nice and sweet guy. I adore him! So, why does there have to be something wrong with this? Why is it considered a mistake to love someone of the same sex? I mean, I like him, and I don&apos;t want to hurt him, but part of me keeps saying this is a mistake, and that hurts. The other day we were both a bit down, and I felt bad and guilty. I don&apos;t know where things will go, but I want to be with him for a long time. I want to be happy with him because he makes me happy now. </p>
                        <p>thing that&apos;s causing conflict within me is everything I&apos;ve learned in my life. My beliefs about divinity, karma, and spirituality are holding me back. I&apos;ve been afraid my whole life, and I still am. I stopped praying to God because I thought I didn&apos;t deserve to be heard since I don&apos;t follow
                         All the rules. I don&apos;t know if I&apos;m wrong about that, but the thing is, I want to pray to God. I want to have that spiritual connection on my own terms. I&apos;m conflicted about this! I want to be enough, to be able to pray without feeling guilty, to have my motivation to be better, not clouded by my life choices, as long as I&apos;m not hurting anyone. That&apos;s what&apos;s truly important: not deceiving anyone, no hurting anyone. God, I&apos;m asking again, give me the willpower I need to live the life I wish. On my own terms-that&apos;s what I truly wish for, deep down! And I believe it will be! I want to achieve all my plans. Come on, God, guide me toward that life, those opportunities, those goals. I pray for this with all my heart. So be it

                <h3 class="titulo3">Question Without Answers</h3>
                    <p>Well, today was a holiday, and I spent most of it relaxing. I had a rehearsal in the morning, but the rest of the afternoon was free. I&apos;ve been wanting to writ since yesterday. Now, I have a date with a guy; it&apos;is my first time, haha. I like him, and I think we have a lot in common. plus, he&apos;s not bad looking, hehe, the truth is, I&apos;m quite anxious because I don&apos;t want anyone to find out about us. I&apos;m relieved that he agreed to keep secret, but I wonder how long that will last. I feel like I&apos;m walking a tightrope and could fall off at anymoment</p>
                    <p>Lately, &apos;ve develop the bad habit of getting bored with people easily. Now I understand what happened with those girls; it wasn&apos;t that I didn&apos;t  like them, but I was afraid of commitment. And it seems like the same thing is happening now. Perhabs it&apos;ll be different because he'&apos;s a guy, which makes it more complicated, and I don&apos;t know what will happen. I&apos;m enjoying myself rigth now, but my mind is racing and creating all sorts of catastrophic scenarios, making conclusions that, with enough force, might become reality!</p>
                    <p>this perceived weakness and mental exhaustion make me feel conflicted because... I don&apos;t Know if it&apos;s just my mind or if my religious upbringing has conditioned me to believe I&apos;m wrong. I&apos;m afraid of the concept of karma because I&apos;ve always been told that people like us carry a heavy karmik burden. I don&apos;t know that&apos;s true, but God, please, release me from this karma. I want you explain to me why it&apos;s bad. I didn&apos;t choose this; I didn&apos;t want to be this way, but this is me.
                    </p>
                    <p>Please give me a sign, a message in my dreams, an alert, some direction, anything. I know there have been great wise masters who gave us their knowledge in books, but they are just humans, and I'm not totally convinced about some details of the knowledge they share with us. If this is so bad, I need a clear conclusion and some guidance on how to stop being this way, while I live in the moment because I like this guy so much, and I don't want to break his heart either. God, I need clarity in my life. I need to know and to be myself too. I need peace, and I think my inner conflicts are affecting my health! I've been so tired, alone, thinking, not achieving many things, and I don't know... what's happening to me. I guess I need a cold shower. Please, guide me to the right path, and if this is wrong, let me know why it doesn't feel bad, because my mind is fighting against me so hard... help.</p>

                    <p>Well, I think that writing before bed might make me feel better. I'm overwhelmed with information, ideas, and needs. The goal I want to achieve will be challenging. I don’t know exactly what I’ll do! I mean, I know what I want to do, but I’m not sure if I can fully control myself. At this moment, I’m reflecting, and I guess I made a mistake by buying more clothes. I shouldn’t have done it now—I should have waited until I become the person I want to be, maybe a few months later. But, well, what’s done is done; I’ve already bought them, and I’ll wear them.</p>
                    <p>I’ve been thinking a lot about investments, and I believe I should focus more on investing in myself. And I will—I’m determined to achieve the body of my dreams. I really wish for it, and I’ll make it happen. I know I need to fix my sleeping habits, and that’s part of why I’m trying this—to see if it helps. I’m taking things step by step, and I believe it’ll work.</p>
                    <p>Today, I’ve been thinking a lot, and maybe some of the things that guy said are true, but it’s embarrassing for me to admit it. I don’t want to dwell on it—it’s all just a bit of a nuisance. Anyway, I think I’m tired now and probably not making much sense. Time to sleep.</p>

                    <p> Well, here we are again. I don’t really have a reflective story to write tonight—this feels more like a petition. Tomorrow is the big concert at 2 PM, and I’m not sure if time will be on my side. So, from this moment on, I’m wishing with all my heart that the packages arrive as early as possible so that I can participate in this project and sing these incredible songs.</p>
                    <p>I just hope everything goes well. Please, God. I know I made a mistake yesterday, but I’ve put so much effort into this—I’ve given my all to make sure this song gets performed on stage.</p>
                    <p>Well, I guess I’m manifesting it now. So be it.</p>

                    <p>Well, it was a complicated day for me today. After everything that happened yesterday, I found myself feeling very anxious. The thought "What mistake did I make today?" kept running through my mind over and over. And, well… it feels like an old version of me has started to resurface—a version that used to be a bit inopportune at times. I thought that part of me had burned out, but I see now that it still rises from the ashes, bringing along a trace of warmth.</p>
                    <p>I feel like I might seem like a nuisance to some people now. I want—no, I need—to fight against this, because if I don’t, my insecurities will grow too overwhelming. This idea that I’m stupid won’t leave me alone, and it’s enough. Enough self-sabotage—it’s time to let it go and go to sleep.</p>

                    <p>Wow, this weekend was eventful. I drank more than I ever thought I would, and I’ve definitely decided I don’t want to do it again. That day, my head was spinning, I had a terrible headache, I felt like vomiting, and I couldn’t keep my balance. It was so embarrassing, especially because I was with my sister and her friends.</p>
                    <p>I think I’ve decided to stop drinking. Yesterday—or rather, early this morning—I realized I need to make some changes. It’s strange how certain things feel so out of place sometimes.</p>

                <h3 class="titulo3">Temptations</h3>
                    <p>Well, I suppose this is another one of those nights where the temptation, the desire, that almost visceral impulse to watch inappropriate content resurfaces, preventing me from sleeping peacefully. I've never written about this before, despite often documenting my insomnia, though rarely for this particular reason. This situation feels quite intense; it's worth noting that my mind seems to exhibit a disordered pattern when these random, nonsensical thoughts intrude. My emotional equilibrium is disrupted, my stomach begins to churn, my body trembles, and a sudden craving for self-indulgence emerges as a means to relax and finally sleep. </p>
                    <p>Yet, it's rarely effective, offering only fleeting respite before the urge returns, accompanied by a morbid curiosity to watch these videos, invariably ending in the same way – succumbing to temptation. What I find particularly unsettling are the subsequent days, which feel heavy, and I suspect it's due to this. I know it's my own failing, but it's incredibly difficult to resist. </p>
                    <p>My body seems to assert its need, recalling past relapses and the temporary gratification, almost luring me back in. Then, driven by a need for sleep or a misguided attempt to reassure myself, I yield, only to be consumed by guilt afterwards. So, the question arises: how do I quell this agitation? How do I make this desire vanish and allow myself to sleep? I've spent a considerable amount of time praying for these thoughts to be banished, but they persistently return, again and again – a cycle of prayer and relapse, with this persistent aspect of my personality tormenting me. Please, God, help me to resist, and if I falter, please let the consequences not be too severe, let them not affect my day, or the following days either. You know that the majority of the time I succumb because this internal struggle is so exhausting, and I desperately need rest.</p>
                    <p>Unsurprisingly, I was unsuccessful; I succumbed after a mere three hours. I did everything within my power, or at least I exerted considerable effort, to resist temptation and achieve sleep, but it proved futile, and I eventually yielded. Now, while I feel a sense of remorse, at least I made an initial attempt at resistance. </p>
                    <p>So, here I am writing, and I'm going to engage in a practice I sometimes employ, though I haven't done so recently: I will manifest and decree that this doesn't affect me, that the desire dissipates, and that everything returns to a state as if nothing untoward ever occurred. I decree that no negative energy lingers with me as a consequence of this lapse. I'm aware this might sound somewhat irrational or cynical regarding my prayer, but I feel compelled to do it to avoid succumbing to a feeling of weakness. These are the final days of the year, so I think I will afford myself a small indulgence, a momentary lapse, and then commence the new year in January with renewed energy, a transformed self, the commencement of a genuine glow-up.</p>

                    <p>Well, I suppose this appears rather bleak; I've once again succumbed to temptation. However, this feels almost like a self-imposed ritual at the year's end, a deliberate indulgence in minor transgressions. I rationalize it as a form of catharsis, a symbolic making of a mess to expunge the accumulated pressures of the year. </p>
                    <p>One engages in these small acts during the final week, followed by a prolonged, purifying shower, meditation, and a recommitment to healthy habits, effectively leaving these minor indiscretions behind, relegated to the past, allowing for a fresh start. Naturally, one wouldn't intentionally repeat errors that yield genuinely damaging consequences, certainly not those that would harm another person; rather, these are personal, small-scale indulgences – a fleeting taste of gluttony, indolence, or perhaps a touch of superficial luxury, lasting only a few days. Of course, with the advent of the new year, a radical shift is imperative, a conscious abstention from these minor failings, exerting every effort to maintain purity and an active lifestyle – a deliberate rebalancing of life, precisely what a genuine glow-up necessitates.</p>

                <p>Well, I suppose this marks the first entry of the new year, and all I can say is that I'm rather perplexed by my current state. Recently, I've found myself drawn to melancholic videos; content that evokes a range of emotions distinct from the urge to watch pornography. It appears that this shift is proving somewhat effective thus far, and I sincerely hope I can finally sleep. It's often said that crying induces sleepiness, and indeed, the profound sadness I feel at having succumbed to this habit, coupled with the anger, disappointment, guilt, and fear – this pervasive uncertainty – necessitates a degree of emotional composure. It is precisely for this reason that I am writing; I suspect I am losing my mental equilibrium, and enough is enough. The last thing I desire is further instability in my life. God, please, if it were possible, eradicate these memories from my mind, purge all that is negative within me, all the morbid content I have consumed.</p>

                <p>It's intriguing that this is occurring precisely now; I mean, when I used to succumb to temptation, I experienced considerable remorse and guilt. However, now that it's a daily occurrence, I feel utterly devoid of emotion, almost as if I've become numb. Moreover, the fact that I'm now watching pornography, which is arguably worse, suggests a profound apathy has taken hold. Even my thoughts are scattered as I write this, likely due to fatigue, but I must endeavor to resume my writing, as when I articulate these feelings and commit my prayers to paper that these situations cease to affect me, it tends to be so. So, to continue, I now wish to add this caveat: I also decree that this does not impede my musical development, negatively impact my professional life, or indeed, adversely affect any aspect of my existence.</p>

                <p>I'm at a loss to explain my current state; I'm experiencing such a profound lack of willpower. Despite my desire to avoid dwelling on it, the effort feels Sisyphean. My thoughts lack clarity, and I find myself yearning for the kind of gratification I observe in those videos, a stark contrast that leaves me feeling profoundly distant. However, I ought to cease this line of thought, lest this situation precipitate further negative consequences. Perhaps my senses are somewhat dulled; nonetheless, I pray for a more auspicious tomorrow. I'm cognizant of my perceived lack of moral standing to offer such a prayer, yet I've witnessed countless individuals do so while leading seemingly ordinary lives. I, too, long for normalcy, for acceptance – the same acceptance I once afforded myself, in the hope that the world might then reciprocate.</p>

                <p>Today was rather uneventful, but alas, it is now night, and as is so often the case, my body is succumbing to the familiar craving for sexual gratification. I managed to endure one night, but I am now uncertain of my ability to replicate that resolve; everything feels muddled. I am torn between conflicting impulses: one seemingly urging me to yield, whispering the allure of immediate pleasure, while the other cautions against it, reminding me to concentrate and persevere. Yet, my mind fixates on the prospect of another sleepless night, ultimately rendering my efforts futile, and indeed, I can already feel the familiar stirrings of arousal.</p>

                <p>It is proving exceedingly difficult to resist; at this juncture, I find myself unable to divert my thoughts from those explicit videos, a preoccupation that is undoubtedly detrimental to me. I suspect that despite my efforts to avoid it, I am likely to succumb, as I've begun to perceive it as the sole means of attaining tranquility. I am aware that I have frequently postponed this indulgence in order to regenerate my mind, affording it fullness and health, but what course of action remains open to me now? I am beset by anxiety; on one hand, my conscience urges abstinence, while another voice rationalizes a minor relapse as inconsequential, even suggesting it as a prerequisite for sleep. These conflicting impulses are overwhelming, and clear thought eludes me. I am uncertain whether to seek assistance, as I fear it would render my entreaties presumptuous and ultimately futile.</p>

                <p>It's been a long time since I last wrote something, and I just want to say this: I'm sorry if I always write sad things, but that's just how it is. I think it's the only way I can express myself, on paper. And I should also say that I've fallen in love, and now I'm completely in love with a cute guy. I don't know if he's just joking with me or just going with the flow, or... I don't know what he wants from me, but I know that all day my heart has been broken because something happened early this morning that left me feeling really down for some reason. I think I just realized that I feel very alone and forgotten. So, I'm trying to keep busy with lots of activities, but right now none of them are making me feel happy. Everything feels normal, and my desire, my enthusiasm, my positive attitude, it's all gone. All because of my broken heart. Now I'm becoming tough again, but it's hard. It used to be easier, but now in this lockdown, every thought makes me angry, and today I couldn't handle it. </p>

                <p>Okay, so I'm back in my secret thoughts, trying to figure out why I've fallen so hard for this guy. I really don't get it. I feel this strong need to talk to him, to kiss him, to have him in my life like it's something super important, like he's the best thing that's ever happened to me. I can barely handle a minute without him. I mean, this doesn't make sense; it's beyond what's reasonable. I even get jealous for no reason, and I get stressed when he doesn't reply to me quickly. But I'm so happy when he does answer, and when we video call or he sends me pictures – he's so good-looking! And also, when he tells me he loves me, that I'm cute, that he wants everything with me, and I want everything with him too. He's seriously driving me crazy and I'm obsessed, and I don't want to be like this. I don't want my happiness to depend on someone else. I should be able to be happy on my own; I just need to work out how. I wish for happiness and peace of mind without needing to be in love.</p>

Now he's not replying, and he usually doesn't take this long. I don't know if he's really busy, or if he's ignoring me, or if something happened to him. But I'm really worried, like, was what he told me last night not real? I honestly don't know! I just know that I miss him and I need to hear from him.</p>

                <p>Okay, so I'm back with the drama from the last couple of months. After getting really into that addiction, the drama with this almost-relationship became way too much for me to handle. Now I'm feeling really down for something that probably doesn't even matter. Or at least, I think it doesn't. And now I know a lot of things about this guy that I wish I didn't know – things that are causing problems for me inside.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I've ended whatever was going on with him. I've realized that we didn't really have much between us; it was all a mystery. We had some fun and interesting nights, but after a while, everything got more confusing and harder to understand. I think it's because of his past, or maybe his current, promiscuous life, because I'm pretty sure he slept with someone last night. Maybe he's still doing that while making me fall for him. I guess I fell for the sweet talk from an eighteen-year-old guy, and I even thought we could have a nice relationship. God, I was so wrong. I imagined things like in romantic movies, but it was just me.</p>
                <p>And I just keep thinking that I miss all of that, and that I should just be quiet and not look for anything on dating apps. Even though it was all wrong, right now I'd feel really lonely and bored.</p>

                <h3 class="titulo3">Come Back to my Senses</h3>
                <p>Okay, let's try to process this new chapter. Right now, it's almost one in the morning, and those unwanted thoughts about everything he does are flooding my mind again. And not only that, but I've also downloaded the dating app again, partly to meet new people, but the real reason is I just want to see if he's back on the app, if he's already slept with someone else – you know, that kind of thing.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, I'm still interested in his insignificant existence, even though he was very important to me at one point. I'm trying to make it just a bad or silly memory, something I could have avoided, but I chose to keep it going. And now, after eight days with a broken heart, well, my therapist says it's a process and that step-by-step things will quiet down. But I still can't shake off the feelings of envy, wanting what he has, anger, dependence – all of that is still there, and I can't stand it. It still hurts. And all those things I wish I didn't know, I just wish I could have let it go, but I can't, or maybe I don't want to yet.</p>
                <p>The thing is, for me, he was really cute, and I didn't want to let go, I really didn't, and I still don't. I want to hold onto him. My mind keeps trying to call him back, wanting him to miss me, to realize how much I'm worth, to tell me he loves me, needs me, that I'll change his life and we'd be happy. And well, I'm still stuck on that. We had a lot of plans together, and now none of that will happen. Everything fell apart; it was all just illusions, and it's hard for me to accept. But there's still a fight inside me, wondering if he needs to move on, or if there was really something there to get over, or if I'm just being dramatic.</p>
                <p>And now I'm coming to my senses, and yes, he was a bad person because he slept with a married man, had sex when he was twelve in a cemetery, and by such a young age had already slept with fourteen guys. And overall, he was more intelligent than me, and he seduced me and made me fall in love. I feel really down; my expectations have collapsed. I mean, I forgot all my moral principles, and I threw them aside for a cute face and a sweet, seductive attitude.</p>
                <p>He's really the most lustful person I've ever known, especially because of the music he listens to. Every song was vulgar, and each one was about sex and being a 'whore' or 'bitch'. And he's so happy about that because he likes being promiscuous; he likes his life full of sexual pleasure and nothing else.</p>
                <p>Because I was genuine, I showed everything, I gave all my feelings, and well, I don't know... I'm still trying to convince myself that I did the right thing – maybe not the best way, but walking away was the most important thing. And I'm already a little calmer.</p>
                <p>But then, in my mind, he becomes the ultimate example of someone promiscuous. Now, when someone talks about cheating, I think of him. It makes this feel so bad, and I can't move on easily. I get attached, and I want to stay attached to him. But the truth is, I want to forget him, forget that it happened, forget that I ever felt something for him. I want to forget what I knew about him and leave it all behind. I want to have peace, and I want to stop caring about what he does with his life. That's not my problem, and it never will be.</p>

                <h3 class="titulo3">the same painful broken heart</h3>
                <p>Well, today was a bit of a strange day. This morning, I went out for a date that ended up not happening. Then my mom called to check on me, and I told her where I was, so we went to see a friend who says he can sense things about people. I didn't really feel like he saw anything in my case – obviously, he can't read my mind; in fact, I even forgot half of what he said! However, some of it was helpful for guidance, so I'll try to use it.</p>
                <p>Today, the main feelings I had were fear and wanting to see him. For example, I went to a restaurant with my family where I got a coffee. I mean, it might be awkward, but my mind keeps going to the thought of what if I see him with another guy? That's something I wonder about every single time I leave the house, and I wonder if I could handle the pain. Another mistake I almost made was suggesting we take my family to eat at the place where he works – luckily, none of us felt like it.</p>
                <p>I have to say that even though I have this horrible habit of imagining him having sex in all sorts of rough places, like a park, a parked bus, or a bathroom, I really wish I didn't know all the things he does, so I wouldn't imagine that there's nowhere in Mérida where he hasn't done it. That makes me feel envy, pity, desire, anger – a never-ending mix of emotions. But that's not the worst part. The question of what if I find him with someone else? That would destroy me; in fact, it is destroying me, the fact of finding him on Grindr. Now, everything else is really frustrating, even though I try my best to see how much better my life is compared to his, how great I am compared to him. But it's not easy. Even though this week was easier than last week, I have met some other guys who seem nice. I hope they become my friends, or maybe even something more.</p>

                <p>Well, today was a really beautiful day. I met a cute guy, and we talked for pretty much the whole afternoon. We got into our lives, it was basically like my therapy, and he gave me good advice and made me think a lot. I really think it made me realize I should be grateful for my life. Maybe I've been too fatalistic about my life recently with everything that's happened to me... with the guy, my broken ankle, the need to be accompanied. I guess maybe I was very dramatic, although I still have my insecurities. But well, I'm working on it, and I'm coming back to being, and will be, my best version.</p>

                <p>Well, I've come back again because I've had another disturbing memory. This time, it's about the moment he told me how he lost his virginity. That story was so intense, so specific, and unusual that I can't even write it down, especially the details he shared. It makes me feel really weird – a mix of envy, lust, disappointment, and pity. I mean, this guy seems so cute, and it just doesn't seem to fit with the experiences he's had. I even thought that maybe he was forced into doing things he didn't really want to do and that he's just been convincing himself he enjoyed it.</p>
                <p>But I need to remember that the world I imagine in my head isn't exactly how things are out there. So, I should try to understand and accept that these kinds of things can happen, and they don't always make sense. It's not necessarily good or bad; it's just that my own ideals shouldn't affect my emotions so strongly, because it ends up making me feel this way – disturbed by it.</p>
                <p>I don't remember what else I wanted to write, but to close this chapter, I want to say: I love myself. I mean, I'm a good friend, and I'm attentive. Even though I don't physically accept myself, I'm grateful that I have the possibility and the tools to become a better version of myself.</p>

                <p>Well, today started a little bit unstable, but it's nothing I can't manage. A lot of topics are going through my mind: learning this, learning that, working on myself, and trying to stop punishing myself and overthinking. It's hard, but the day has barely started, so I'll keep going calmly.</p>
                <p>Well, it's the end of the day, and I want to write. I've realized that I've been abandoning fear. It's terrifying for me when someone doesn't respond to me. It makes me feel fear and anxiety. I think so much about what I did wrong and constantly wonder what I'm failing at that makes people move away from me. It makes me feel resentful and negative feelings, and I don't understand why, even if they are people I've only recently met, even from other countries.</p>
                <p>Rejection is something that should be common, and it doesn't matter if you know you're a very good person or if you use very nice words. If they stop talking to you, it's okay. You're never left over just because they stopped, and you must be at peace with that. Don't take it too personally; just let it go, like the memories that sometimes left this guy.</p>
                <p>Perhaps that's why it still affects you – because there was a lot you couldn't know, and you feel the conflict. That part of you wants to know, but at the same time doesn't, because you fear the truth might destroy your ideals about him. And actually, maybe you were wrong, and that's why it's just better for some questions to remain unanswered. You can keep going your way without searching for more explanations about something that can't affect you if you don't let it</p>

                <p>Well, today I'm back. I'd forgotten to write these past few days, and well, things have happened. I broke my streak of days without masturbating and watching porn, which was disappointing for me. But on the other hand, I've met so many people recently, especially from other countries, and it's really interesting. Ultimately, I've had signs from the universe that make me feel I should be grateful.</p>
                <p>However, I have a dilemma. I can't seem to stop procrastinating. I think about my activities and responsibilities, I try to do them, but I get tired. I don't know how to get my energy back to what it was before. I'm constantly living with frustration, and I find myself trying to fill an emptiness inside me by meeting new guys.</p>

                <h3 class="titulo3">The Reasons Why</h3>
                <p>Today was a very quiet day, and it made me think about something... Maybe I give too much energy and time to people who don't appreciate it as much as I do, and I'm feeling a bit frustrated about this. For example, today I thought my friend would talk to me in the afternoon, but she didn't. To be honest, I feel it's a bit disrespectful because we were supposed to talk today, so we were going to catch up. But she didn't respond to my message, or even text me later.</p>
                <p>Sometimes I think I should have other, better friends, and I think Victor has been a very good friend recently. It seems like a really nice friendship. Steffany and I get along really well; we're like soulmates. But I feel like I put in a lot of effort to maintain this ideal of friendship.</p>
                <p>However, I should also remember that having expectations or fixed ideas about how everyone else should be with us isn't healthy. Because afterwards, I feel disappointed and stressed when people aren't the way I'd like them to be. But I am starting to see who I should be kinder to, and it seems Victor is winning in this regard.</p>
                <p>My best friend texted me yesterday just to ask for money and hasn't replied since. However, I'm starting to realize how she always seems to put me down, and it reminds me of the mistake I made when I told her about Meicker's breakup. She said things like, 'If she finds out, she won't talk to you anymore.' Honestly, my mind tends to be very pessimistic.</p>
                <p>Something I'm understanding while writing this is that these kinds of situations only really get resolved in the moment they happen; they don't get resolved in my mind. In my mind, it just becomes an exaggerated problem, like my work issues. It doesn't get fixed in my head, but yes, in the moment. Of course, I need to be prepared, but my anxiety is fighting against me, taking my need for control to an extreme and giving me completely unnecessary stress.</p>
                <p>The same thing happened with the message from Soleany. It's not a terrible issue, and it's not something I should or would want to get so involved in. I think about so many things, and the feeling of not being in control just leads to repeated reactions. The control I think I have is actually an illusion. This illusion makes me want even more control, and the worst part is that this control only exists in my mind; it's not external. You're not acting, not moving; you're not really doing anything, just through your phone. And if you think about it, the action you're taking is actually doing nothing, and therefore, it's a waste of time.</p>
                <p>You have a strong need to connect with people, to communicate, maybe to fill a void or create an illusion, because no matter how good the relationship is, your mind sees it as a huge achievement. This is because it was always difficult for you to make friends when you were a child and teenager, so your mind sees these connections as a big feat that should be recognized and celebrated, even though it's actually just normal, casual behavior.</p>
                <p>The idea of meeting new people happens unconsciously because your conscious mind knows you are actually quite social. But this past hurt still reflects in your subconscious – that child who didn't know how to talk to other children, who didn't have friends and didn't know how to make them. Despite many years passing, even these small situations trigger stress and make you put yourself down.</p>
                <p>Then comes the moment to decide how these past hurts will affect you, and I'm deciding to leave the drama behind and realize that I'm an adult with more important things to focus on. But basically, it's this: the act of socializing makes you feel like you're moving forward; it feels less static. It's not so much the loneliness, but the need to move on that gets filled when you talk to a lot of people.</p>
                <p>I guess that's similar to when I want to masturbate and watch porn. Everything is moving inside me, everything is moving on the screen at that moment, and that's why I do it – to feel like I exist. That's what I'm doing: I'm searching for temporary pleasures to satisfy my need for movement, instead of focusing on more productive activities. And the worst part is that I don't want to stop doing it, even though I remember the consequences. I want to keep acting in this impulsive and misguided way.</p>

                <h3 class="titulo3">Hard Early Morning</h3>
                <p>So, the morning was a bit messy. I can just say that early on I masturbated two times, and then again this morning. It felt like I couldn't stop, or well, I wanted to stop but also didn't really want to. I really wanted to feel like I was having sex. It's not just about watching porn when I do it, it's that I was awake. I didn't sleep at all until 4 in the morning, and the cat next door also kept me awake. Anyway, I've had a coffee now, and I think I feel more awake to talk about this. The day is going by, and I'm still wasting time; I can't find another job. This afternoon, I went with my sister to her therapy and then went to the pool, which was fine. But I won't say I didn't feel worried about everyone else seeing me when I was walking or waiting for the bus... but I need to walk, I need to move around; I have to. And I'm just trying to write and remember that I really wanted to write, but I can't, or I don't remember what, or I don't want to – I don't know. I just know that right now I'm trying to sleep and I can't. Right now, I just thought about masturbating, thinking I can control it; but I don't know... I know I'll probably end up doing it.</p>

                <p>Okay, it's just after midnight, so today is the important day I've been waiting for. And well, I'm nervous because I have to work tomorrow, and I hope I can leave really early so I have quiet time to get ready to sing and do my best. Also, the idea that the charger might arrive late makes me feel nervous, but I'm saying it won't happen. </p>

                <h3 class="titulo3">Last Day of the year</h3>
                <p>Okay, so it's the morning of December 30th, and I just wanted to say that a lot has happened this year since I last wrote. For a start, I'm not a virgin anymore, and I've had three sexual partners so far. It was all kind of in order, I mean, I was really careful the first time, less so the second, and the third time I don't think I was very careful at all. I was bottom and didn't use a condom, and even though the risk is pretty low now after giving in, I'm really worried. My anxiety is keeping me up because of what happened last night. I mean, I think about it, and I feel like an idiot for not using protection, for not acting the best way. I was really irresponsible, and now I feel guilty, stupid, and scared about what might happen. I've looked into it, and it seems I probably shouldn't be too worried, but I'm still scared, so much that I don't think I'll have sex for a long time. This year has definitely been rough in a lot of ways. I'm thinking about things, and I shouldn't have gone back last night, but I did, and what was going to happen, happened. I just hope there won't be any consequences for this mistake, and I hope there won't be, but my mind is really tough on me and shows me terrible situations where everything goes wrong. And then it's hard for me to remember and believe that most of these situations, like 80 percent of them, only happen in my head and won't actually happen. That's the most likely thing, more than all those really dramatic things I imagine.</p>
                <p>It's hard to admit, but my pride is really hurt. I usually try to be very careful about these things, and I know how to be, but this time I chose not to be. And that's what bothers me most. I'm angry and stressed with myself because I did the very thing, I criticize others for – not being responsible. My mind is really upset, and that's why I'm writing this, to get my anger out. I'm also really anxious, even though the risk of getting anything is very low. I keep telling myself that nothing bad will happen, that I won't catch anything. I don't know if I'm being stupid, but I'm trusting what this guy told me, and I hope he was telling the truth. After all, there wasn't even direct contact, because he didn't finish inside me or on me, and neither did I. So, the risk is much lower than the already small chance in general. But I need to stop all the bad habits I've picked up this year: no more heavy drinking, smoking, unprotected sex, or anything else that's damaging my life. That's it. This year, I want to find peace, grow as a person, and achieve my goals, leaving all the problems, bad experiences, and conflicts behind. My pride is being difficult and trying to hold me back, especially with what happened last night, trying to make me feel bad about myself. I'm fighting against that, trying to ignore those thoughts. I need to remember that I'm not a bad person. I mean, I'm not perfect, but I try not to hurt anyone, and I think I deserve good things, not bad. I don't know how to get rid of these thoughts that are bothering me so much. They're making me feel unwell, and I think that's why I'm stuck and not moving forward in other areas of my life. These thoughts are strong, especially the regrets, the constant "what ifs" – "what if I had done things differently," "what if I hadn't..." And the funny thing is, nothing bad has even happened yet, but my mind is driving me crazy, repeating these regrets and telling me that if I hadn't done that, I wouldn't be feeling this anxious. That might be true, but I need to move on. I need to stop overthinking every little thing that happened. There's nothing more to think about; it's done. I can't change the past, but my pride won't accept that. That's why I'm writing all this. I've already imagined every possible scenario, every consequence, and there's nothing more I can do or think about. Even now, while I'm writing, I should just accept that I made a mistake and promise myself not to repeat it. But deep down, I don't want to accept it, because I think that means accepting bad consequences, and I don't want that. But that's not how it works. Your mind tries to make everything in your body's development logical and consistent with your life experiences. And maybe that's why your life is chaotic, or has always been, because your mind is working against you, without a good pattern to follow, so things don't work as well as they could. So, that's what you need to work on: reprogramming your mind to stop those unwanted thoughts. Even though I've written a lot, my mind still isn't completely calm. It's a bit calmer, but not enough; it keeps going over and over things. Okay, I'm going to fight it again.</p>

                <p>Right, it's a new year, and it's had a good start in some ways. Today was really quiet, but in the last hour, I left my amulet at the gym. Now I'm worried because it's a real object, you can't replace it, and it's very rare. I hope someone bad doesn't find it.</p>

                <h3 class="titulo3">Great Beginnings</h3>
                <p>So, the last few days have been really quiet and helpful. But now, I can't stop thinking about trying not to masturbate. My mind is trying to tell me it's not a bad thing, and honestly, I don't know what to think. In the past, it felt like the worst thing ever. Actually, I've been remembering a lot of times from when I was a teenager when I used to feel really bad emotionally about it. Anyway, I've also been thinking about other things, like why my best friend hasn't replied to me when she's posted something online. She could have replied, but she didn't, and it makes me wonder what kind of friends I have. Then I remembered a time in the past when I was on my own and it was fine, I didn't even depend on anyone emotionally. And I also think about the new friends I have now; they're better, they're the same, they're real?</p>
                <p>So, to sum up, I'm on my own, and it's just me and my family who have always been there. Because of that, I think this year I'm going to be stronger about this. I'll be more private again, and I'll try to stay really calm, focusing on the things I really want to do, and I think I've been doing that so far. I went to Cacute for those first weekends, and I managed... not a huge amount, but little by little, things will get done. And this week I'm going back to dancing, which was great. I'm going to try and make this dance better so I can put it on social media – it's been a really busy week. However, I'm worried I might give in to temptation. I really don't want to do it, but my mind keeps pushing me, and even though I'm fighting it, my mind is playing tricks on me. Anyway, in other news, I'm back at the gym, and I felt amazing dancing and working out. I felt strong, I've been working on fixing up my house, and I can concentrate better. It's also possible that I have given in to temptation.</p>

                <h3 class="titulo3">Here we go again</h3>
                <p>Well, I'm back to this habit of writing my diary, first on the computer and then on paper. So, here we go.</p>
                <p>I've been thinking a lot about the possibility of changing jobs. Yesterday, I worked on my CV and felt like I did a good job. But the truth is, even though I know I can do all those things I wrote down, I feel like I don't have enough experience. That makes me feel scared. I feel unable to actually do anything I listed on my CV. It's frustrating because sometimes I feel so confident – like I could design a website without problems, speak English fluently, or design in AutoCAD without any doubt. Then, other times, I feel completely lost. It's truly frustrating.</p>
                <p>On top of that, my current job has become a bit toxic. Honestly, it's always been that way, but now it feels worse. That's why I really want to find a new job, but it's not easy. Right now, I'm in a very uncomfortable situation because my schedule was changed. Now I don't have time to dance, or even go to my choir rehearsals. It feels like a thousand things just collapsed because of this schedule change. I'm not sure what to do with all the things I'm supposed to be doing: dance class, choir, piano class... With English, I don't have any problem, as that class is at night and I'm almost finished with the course, which is another thing that worries me a bit. But, well, it's just a matter of doing one thing at a time.</p>
                <p>P.S.: I finished my website about my autobiography from the last three years, and I feel very proud of it.</p>
